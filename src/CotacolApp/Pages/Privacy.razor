    However, if you want to have your activities integrated (to know which cols you climbed, to participate in challenges, or to be listed on our leaderboards) 
    we do need access to your StravaÂ® data. Additionally, our mobile apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play require internet access to connect with our API, 
    and require access to your location if you want to display your location on the map.</p>
